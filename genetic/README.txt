Genetic Algorithm - Cosc343
Zac Seales

Uses a genetic algorithm to solve the "8 queen puzzle", in which 8 queens
are placed on a chessboard so that no queen can take the other.

An initial population size is chosen and for a number of generations, children are
created from the "fittest" instances.

Parent fitness value is determined by the number of queens in a 'correct position'.
