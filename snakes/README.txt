Snake game

An AI project that showcases machine learning using a genetic algorithm
and single layer perceptron models.

The artificial neuron (perceptron) begins with random parameter values, and each generation of snakes
is assigned a fitness value dependent on their game performance.

Snakes in the next game have their perceptron parameters determined by using the fittest snakes 
from the previous generation.

Average fitness scores are then plotted so that the learning trend can be visualized.
